# EfficientNet and Data Labeling Notebooks

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks: `EfficientNet.ipynb` and `Lableing.ipynb`, which showcase the implementation of an EfficientNet model and a data labeling workflow, respectively.

## EfficientNet.ipynb

### Overview
`EfficientNet.ipynb` demonstrates how to train a convolutional neural network using the EfficientNet architecture. This architecture is known for its efficiency and scalability, making it suitable for tasks that require high performance with limited computational resources.

### Key Features
- **Dataset Preparation**: Loading and preprocessing the dataset for training and testing.
- **Model Building**: Initializing an EfficientNet model, customizing layers if needed.
- **Training Configuration**: Defining loss functions, optimizers, and metrics for training.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance on unseen data.

### Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install tensorflow keras`
2. Run the notebook to execute each step, from loading data to training the model.

## Lableing.ipynb

### Overview
`Lableing.ipynb` provides a framework for labeling datasets, a critical step in supervised machine learning projects. The notebook helps visualize data, assign or verify labels, and export the labeled dataset for further use.

### Key Features
- **Dataset Visualization**: Inspect the data to understand its structure and distribution.
- **Labeling Process**: Apply or modify labels for data points.
- **Export**: Save the labeled dataset in a format suitable for machine learning pipelines.

### Usage
1. Ensure the dataset is accessible in the notebook's expected directory.
2. Follow the steps to label data points and save the results.
